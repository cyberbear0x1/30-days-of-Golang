# 30 Days of Golang ⚡️

This repository is a record of my 30-day journey learning Golang. 📚 It follows a condensed version of a 100-day Golang learning plan, focusing on core concepts and practical experience. 🚀

## Project Structure 📁

This repository is organized as follows:

* **day-XX:** Each directory represents a day of learning. 📅 It may contain code examples, exercises, or notes. 📝
* **README.md:** This file (you're reading it now!) provides an overview of the project and its structure. ✨

## Learning Resources 📖

* **100 Days of Golang: A Complete Guide For Beginners:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-golang/ (This plan is based on a condensed version of this resource.)
* Additional resources used throughout the 30 days will be documented in the corresponding day folders (day-XX).

## Daily Breakdown 📆

A high-level overview of the daily breakdown is provided below. Refer to the day-XX folders for specific details, code examples, and daily challenges.

    * **Challenge:** Install Go and run a simple "Hello, World!" program.

* **Day 2: Basic Syntax, Data Types** 🔡
    * **Challenge:** Declare variables of different data types (int, float64, string, bool), perform basic arithmetic operations, and print the results.

* **Day 3: Control Flow (if/else, for loops, switch) 🔀**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.

* **Day 4: Functions 🛠️**
    * **Challenge:** Create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

* **Day 5: Strings 💬**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that reverses a given string.

* **Day 6: Arrays, Slices 📊**
    * **Challenge:** Create a program that finds the maximum and minimum values in an array of integers.

* **Day 7: Structs 📦**
    * **Challenge:** Define a struct to represent a person (name, age, city) and create a slice of people.

* **Day 8: Pointers 📍**
    * **Challenge:** Write a function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

* **Day 9: Error Handling ⚠️**
    * **Challenge:** Write a function that reads a file and returns an error if the file cannot be opened.

* **Day 10: File I/O 💾**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that reads data from a CSV file and stores it in a slice of structs.

* **Day 11: Goroutines 🏃‍♂️**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that uses goroutines to print a sequence of numbers concurrently.

* **Day 12: Channels 📡**
    * **Challenge:** Create a program that uses channels to send and receive data between two goroutines.

* **Day 13: Concurrency Patterns 🌐**
    * **Challenge:** Implement a producer-consumer pattern using goroutines and channels.

* **Day 14: WaitGroups, Mutexes 🤝**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that uses waitgroups and mutexes to synchronize access to a shared resource.

* **Day 15: Context 🗺️**
    * **Challenge:** Write a program that uses context to cancel long-running operations.

* **Day 16: Interfaces 🧩**
    * **Challenge:** Define an interface for a shape and implement it for circle and rectangle structs.

* **Day 17: Testing 🧪**
    * **Challenge:** Write unit tests for the shape interface and its implementations.

* **Day 18: Web Development Introduction 🌐**
    * **Challenge:** Create a simple HTTP server that handles GET requests.

* **Day 19: Project Planning 📝**
    * **Challenge:** Choose a small project idea and outline the project plan.

* **Day 20: Project Setup 🏗️**
    * **Challenge:** Set up the project structure and dependencies.

* **Day 21-25: Project Development** 🛠️
    * **Daily Challenge:** Continue working on the chosen project, implementing features and addressing any challenges.

* **Day 26: Code Optimization 🚀**
    * **Challenge:** Review and optimize the code for performance and readability.

* **Day 27: Explore Advanced Topics (generics, reflection) 🔍**
    * **Challenge:** Learn about generics and reflection and try to implement a simple example using one of these concepts.

* **Day 28: Research and Learn (new libraries, community resources) 📚**
    * **Challenge:** Research and explore a new Golang library or framework.

* **Day 29: Project Presentation 🗣️**
    * **Challenge:** Prepare a presentation or documentation for your project.

* **Day 30: Plan for Continued Learning 📈**
    * **Challenge:** Define your next learning goals and how you plan to continue learning Golang.
