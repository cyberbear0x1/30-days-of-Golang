# 30 Days of Golang ⚡️

This repository is a record of my 30-day journey learning Golang. 📚 It follows a condensed version of a 100-day Golang learning plan, focusing on core concepts and practical experience. 🚀

## Project Structure 📁

This repository is organized as follows:

* **day-XX:** Each directory represents a day of learning. 📅 It may contain code examples, exercises, or notes. 📝
