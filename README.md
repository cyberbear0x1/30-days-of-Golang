# 30 Days of Golang

This repository is a record of my 30-day journey learning Golang. It follows a condensed version of a 100-day Golang learning plan, focusing on core concepts and practical experience.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

* **day-XX:** Each directory represents a day of learning. It may contain code examples, exercises, or notes. 
* **README.md:** This file (you're reading it now!) provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## Learning Resources

* **100 Days of Golang: A Complete Guide For Beginners:** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-golang/ (This plan is based on a condensed version of this resource.)
* Additional resources used throughout the 30 days will be documented in the corresponding day folders (day-XX).
