Welcome to the Go String Reversal Lab! In this lab, your task is to implement a function named reverseString that takes a single string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

Instructions
Function Requirements:

Create a function named reverseString.
The function should take a single string as input.
The function should return the reversed version of the input string.
Challenges:

You will need to complete three challenges to test your function:
Challenge 1: Reverse the string "monkeytype".
Challenge 2: Reverse the string "123456".
Challenge 3: Reverse the string "superheavy".
Testing:

Your function will be automatically tested against several test cases.
Ensure that your function correctly reverses the strings as specified in each challenge.
Hints:

Consider using a helper function to reverse the string.
Remember that strings in Go are immutable, so you will need to convert the string to a slice of runes or characters to manipulate it.
Example
Here is an example of what your function should do:

input := "hello"
output := reverseString(input)
// output should be "olleh"
Submission
Write your reverseString function in the provided coding environment.
Run the tests to check if your function works correctly.
Once all tests pass, you have successfully completed the lab!
Good luck, and happy coding!

Challenges Information
Challenge 1: Reverse the String "monkeytype"
Description: Implement a function named reverseString that takes a single string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

Input: "monkeytype"

Expected Output: "epytyeknom"

Purpose: This challenge tests the basic functionality of the reverseString function with a common word. Make sure your function correctly reverses the input string.

Challenge 2: Reverse the String "123456"
Description: Implement a function named reverseString that takes a single string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

Input: "123456"

Expected Output: "654321"

Purpose: This challenge ensures that the function can handle numeric strings and maintains the sequence of characters. Make sure your function correctly reverses the input string.

Challenge 3: Reverse the String "superheavy"
Description: Implement a function named reverseString that takes a single string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

Input: "superheavy"

Expected Output: "yvaehrepus"

Purpose: This challenge tests the function with another word, ensuring consistency and correctness across different inputs. Make sure your function correctly reverses the input string.
